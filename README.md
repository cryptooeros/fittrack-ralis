## HOW TO RUN THE APP
   Setup

Start by cloning (not forking) the project template repository and removing the remote:

$ git clone git@github.com:learn-co-curriculum/project-template-react-rails-api.git your-project-name
$ cd your-project-name
$ git remote rm origin

Then, create a new remote repository on GitHub. Head to github.com and click the + icon in the top-right corner and follow the steps to create a new repository. Important: don't check any of the options such as 'Add a README file', 'Add a .gitignore file', etc. â€” since you're importing an existing repository, creating any of those files on GitHub will cause issues.

If you're working with a partner, add them as a collaborator on GitHub. From your repo on GitHub, go to Settings > Manage Access > Invite a collaborator and enter your partner's username. Once your partner has access, they should git clone (not fork) the repository.

Finally, connect the GitHub remote repository to your local repository and push up your code:

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-project-name.git
$ git push -u origin main

When you're ready to start building your project, run:

bundle install
rails db:create
npm install --prefix client

You can use the following commands to run the application:

    rails s: run the backend on http://localhost:3000
    npm start --prefix client: run the frontend on http://localhost:4000

Before starting the app make sure you have the required installations
